Nice-to-have: advanced analytics, third-party integrations, mobile app.\n\n**Question 4:** Advanced reporting features, complex workflow automation, and extensive third-party integrations can be added in future versions.\n\n\n### Technical Requirements\n**Question 1:** Integration with Slack for notifications, Google Workspace for file sharing, and basic email integration for external stakeholders.\n\n**Question 2:** React/Node.js stack preferred, PostgreSQL database, deployed on cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling capabilities.\n\n**Question 3:** Should handle 100+ concurrent users, fast load times (&lt;2 seconds), real-time updates with minimal delay.\n\n**Question 4:** Primarily web browser on desktop and tablet, but should be mobile-responsive for occasional mobile use.\n\n\n### Product Focus\n**Question 1:** Eliminates the chaos of scattered task communication and missed deadlines that plague remote teams working across different time zones.\n\n**Question 2:** Quickly assign tasks with clear deadlines, track real-time progress, and get instant visibility into team workload and blockers.\n\n**Question 3:** Slack API for notifications, Google Calendar for deadline sync, Jira integration for existing workflows, and basic time tracking APIs.\n\n**Question 4:** Real-time collaboration without the complexity of enterprise tools - simple enough for small teams but powerful enough to scale with growth.\n\n\n### Design & Experience\n**Question 1:** Professional and modern feel, similar to Slack or Notion - clean but not sterile, approachable for business users.\n\n**Question 2:** Really like how Asana handles task organization and Linear handles clean, focused design without being too minimal.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution Architecture\n\nBased on your requirements, we recommend:\n\n- **Primary Technology Stack:** React.js frontend with Node.js backend\n- **Database:** PostgreSQL for reliable data storage\n- **Authentication:** Secure user authentication system\n- **Platform:** Cross Platform application\n- **Design Style:** Minimal Clinical\n\n## Feature Priority Matrix\n\n### P0 Features (Must Have - MVP)\n- User authentication and account management\n- Core application functionality\n- Basic user interface and navigation\n\n### P1 Features (Should Have)\n- Analytics dashboard and reporting\n- Social features and content sharing\n- Notification system\n- Mobile responsive design\n\n### P2 Features (Nice to Have)\n- AI-powered features and recommendations\n- Third-party integrations\n- Advanced administrative features\n\n\n## Success Metrics\nBased on your product focus:\n- Eliminates the chaos of scattered task communication and missed deadlines that plague remote teams working across different time zones.\n- Quickly assign tasks with clear deadlines, track real-time progress, and get instant visibility into team workload and blockers.\n- Slack API for notifications, Google Calendar for deadline sync, Jira integration for existing workflows, and basic time tracking APIs.\n- Real-time collaboration without the complexity of enterprise tools - simple enough for small teams but powerful enough to scale with growth.\n\n## Timeline Estimate\n- **Discovery & Approval:** Same day\n- **AI Development:** A few minutes (depending on server load)\n- **Testing & Refinement:** Continuous with each feature\n- **Total Project Duration:** A few minutes depending on server load\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Client Approval** - Digital signature and formal acceptance required\n2. **Feature-Driven Development** - Build application feature by feature\n3. **Progressive Delivery** - Complete, integrated application delivery\n4. **Quality Assurance** - Systematic testing and refinement\n\n---\n**Generated by:** TurkeyCode.ai Professional Discovery System\n**Approval Required:** Digital signature and formal acceptance\n",

Nice-to-have: advanced analytics, third-party integrations, mobile app.\n\n**Question 4:** Advanced reporting features, complex workflow automation, and extensive third-party integrations can be added in future versions.\n\n\n### Technical Requirements\n**Question 1:** Integration with Slack for notifications, Google Workspace for file sharing, and basic email integration for external stakeholders.\n\n**Question 2:** React/Node.js stack preferred, PostgreSQL database, deployed on cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling capabilities.\n\n**Question 3:** Should handle 100+ concurrent users, fast load times (&lt;2 seconds), real-time updates with minimal delay.\n\n**Question 4:** Primarily web browser on desktop and tablet, but should be mobile-responsive for occasional mobile use.\n\n\n### Product Focus\n**Question 1:** Eliminates the chaos of scattered task communication and missed deadlines that plague remote teams working across different time zones.\n\n**Question 2:** Quickly assign tasks with clear deadlines, track real-time progress, and get instant visibility into team workload and blockers.\n\n**Question 3:** Slack API for notifications, Google Calendar for deadline sync, Jira integration for existing workflows, and basic time tracking APIs.\n\n**Question 4:** Real-time collaboration without the complexity of enterprise tools - simple enough for small teams but powerful enough to scale with growth.\n\n\n### Design & Experience\n**Question 1:** Professional and modern feel, similar to Slack or Notion - clean but not sterile, approachable for business users.\n\n**Question 2:** Really like how Asana handles task organization and Linear handles clean, focused design without being too minimal.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution Architecture\n\nBased on your requirements, we recommend:\n\n- **Primary Technology Stack:** React.js frontend with Node.js backend\n- **Database:** PostgreSQL for reliable data storage\n- **Authentication:** Secure user authentication system\n- **Platform:** Cross Platform application\n- **Design Style:** Minimal Clinical\n\n## Feature Priority Matrix\n\n### P0 Features (Must Have - MVP)\n- User authentication and account management\n- Core application functionality\n- Basic user interface and navigation\n\n### P1 Features (Should Have)\n- Analytics dashboard and reporting\n- Social features and content sharing\n- Notification system\n- Mobile responsive design\n\n### P2 Features (Nice to Have)\n- AI-powered features and recommendations\n- Third-party integrations\n- Advanced administrative features\n\n\n## Success Metrics\nBased on your product focus:\n- Eliminates the chaos of scattered task communication and missed deadlines that plague remote teams working across different time zones.\n- Quickly assign tasks with clear deadlines, track real-time progress, and get instant visibility into team workload and blockers.\n- Slack API for notifications, Google Calendar for deadline sync, Jira integration for existing workflows, and basic time tracking APIs.\n- Real-time collaboration without the complexity of enterprise tools - simple enough for small teams but powerful enough to scale with growth.\n\n## Timeline Estimate\n- **Discovery & Approval:** Same day\n- **AI Development:** A few minutes (depending on server load)\n- **Testing & Refinement:** Continuous with each feature\n- **Total Project Duration:** A few minutes depending on server load\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Client Approval** - Digital signature and formal acceptance required\n2. **Feature-Driven Development** - Build application feature by feature\n3. **Progressive Delivery** - Complete, integrated application delivery\n4. **Quality Assurance** - Systematic testing and refinement\n\n---\n**Generated by:** TurkeyCode.ai Professional Discovery System\n**Approval Required:** Digital signature and formal acceptance\n",
      "instructions": "CRITICAL: You must build according to this approved scope document.\n\nSCOPE BOUNDARIES:\n- Build ONLY what is specified in the scope\n- DO NOT add features marked as \"Out of Scope\"\n- Follow the acceptance criteria exactly\n- Any questions about scope should be escalated to PM\n\nQUALITY STANDARDS:\n- All work must meet the success metrics defined in scope\n- Follow the technical architecture specified\n- Ensure your work integrates with other approved features\n\n\nDEMO FOCUS:\n- Demo approved features only\n- Highlight how acceptance criteria are met\n- Show alignment with success metrics"
