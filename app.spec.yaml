  document: "# \U0001F983 PROJECT SCOPE DOCUMENT\n\n## Project Overview\n**Generated
    on:** August 13, 2025 at 03:52 PM\n**Project Name:** TaskTurkey Pro\n**Status:**
    Draft - Awaiting Client Approval\n\n## Discovery Summary\n\n### User & Market
    Analysis\n**Question 1:** Remote team managers and project coordinators in companies
    with 10-100 employees who need better task visibility and team coordination.\n\n**Question
    2:** They struggle with task visibility across team members, missed deadlines,
    and lack of real-time progress updates in distributed teams.\n\n**Question 3:**
    Currently using basic tools like email, Slack messages, or simple spreadsheets
    which lack proper task tracking and team coordination features.\n\n**Question
    4:** Real-time updates, integrated team chat, automatic progress tracking, and
    comprehensive team analytics that other tools lack.\n\n\n### Core Features Requirements\n**Question
    1:** Task creation and assignment, real-time progress tracking, team chat integration,
    deadline management, and team analytics dashboard.\n\n**Question 2:** Manager
    creates project → assigns tasks to team members → team members update progress
    → manager monitors via dashboard → team communicates through integrated chat.\n\n**Question
    3:** Must-have: task assignment, progress tracking, team notifications. Nice-to-have:
    advanced analytics, third-party integrations, mobile app.\n\n**Question 4:** Advanced
    reporting features, complex workflow automation, and extensive third-party integrations
    can be added in future versions.\n\n\n### Technical Requirements\n**Question 1:**
    Integration with Slack for notifications, Google Workspace for file sharing, and
    basic email integration for external stakeholders.\n\n**Question 2:** React/Node.js
    stack preferred, PostgreSQL database, deployed on cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling
    capabilities.\n\n**Question 3:** Should handle 100+ concurrent users, fast load
    times (&lt;2 seconds), real-time updates with minimal delay.\n\n**Question 4:**
    Primarily web browser on desktop and tablet, but should be mobile-responsive for
    occasional mobile use.\n\n\n### Product Focus\n**Question 1:** Eliminates the
    chaos of scattered task communication and missed deadlines that plague remote
    teams working across different time zones.\n\n**Question 2:** Quickly assign tasks
    with clear deadlines, track real-time progress, and get instant visibility into
    team workload and blockers.\n\n**Question 3:** Slack API for notifications, Google
    Calendar for deadline sync, Jira integration for existing workflows, and basic
    time tracking APIs.\n\n**Question 4:** Real-time collaboration without the complexity
    of enterprise tools - simple enough for small teams but powerful enough to scale
    with growth.\n\n\n### Design & Experience\n**Question 1:** Professional and modern
    feel, similar to Slack or Notion - clean but not sterile, approachable for business
    users.\n\n**Question 2:** Really like how Asana handles task organization and
    Linear handles clean, focused design without being too minimal.\n\n\n## Proposed
    Solution Architecture\n\nBased on your requirements, we recommend:\n\n- **Primary
    Technology Stack:** React.js frontend with Node.js backend\n- **Database:** PostgreSQL
    for reliable data storage\n- **Authentication:** Secure user authentication system\n-
    **Platform:** Cross Platform application\n- **Design Style:** Minimal Clinical\n\n##
    Feature Priority Matrix\n\n### P0 Features (Must Have - MVP)\n- User authentication
    and account management\n- Core application functionality\n- Basic user interface
    and navigation\n\n### P1 Features (Should Have)\n- Analytics dashboard and reporting\n-
    Social features and content sharing\n- Notification system\n- Mobile responsive
    design\n\n### P2 Features (Nice to Have)\n- AI-powered features and recommendations\n-
    Third-party integrations\n- Advanced administrative features\n\n\n## Success Metrics\nBased
    on your product focus:\n- Eliminates the chaos of scattered task communication
    and missed deadlines that plague remote teams working across different time zones.\n-
    Quickly assign tasks with clear deadlines, track real-time progress, and get instant
    visibility into team workload and blockers.\n- Slack API for notifications, Google
    Calendar for deadline sync, Jira integration for existing workflows, and basic
    time tracking APIs.\n- Real-time collaboration without the complexity of enterprise
    tools - simple enough for small teams but powerful enough to scale with growth.\n\n##
    Timeline Estimate\n- **Discovery & Approval:** Same day\n- **AI Development:**
    A few minutes (depending on server load)\n- **Testing & Refinement:** Continuous
    with each feature\n- **Total Project Duration:** A few minutes depending on server
    load\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Client Approval** - Digital signature and formal acceptance
    required\n2. **Feature-Driven Development** - Build application feature by feature\n3.
    **Progressive Delivery** - Complete, integrated application delivery\n4. **Quality
    Assurance** - Systematic testing and refinement\n\n---\n**Generated by:** TurkeyCode.ai
